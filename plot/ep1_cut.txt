I want to tell a lot about myself and that might take a while, i think that is important for you all to understand my capabilities and motives in terms of this project. Additionally, if you are just starting in game development, you may find it interesting. So... Honestly, i started a long, long time ago. I've always wanted to make a first-person shooter, simply because i'm a big fan of this genre. It started when i was 12, i decided to learn more about the Java programming language to make a Minecraft Forge mod. Back then i thought that would be a nice idea to do so because, as much as i heard about it, creation of game modifications is one of the ways to learn more about the game development in general. Sadly, i still didn't make any Minecraft mods because, during the reading of "Head First Java" book, i switched my attention completely from learning the Minecraft modmaking to learning the Java in general. When i was 13, i participated in "competitive programming" events that improved my knowledge about data structures and algorithms in general. Given that background, i would say that i think about videogames from programming standpoint in first place, and, as it follows, i give it more priority than anything else. When i was almost 14, i started to realize that i didn't learn much about Java, because programming events required me to use Pascal programming language in order to able to participate. I barely had 400 pages that i readed and i realized that i don't even remember any of them, so i started from scratch. I also realized that my brains are getting very bored during the process of learning and coding even if i had an actual interest in programming. Music was the thing i missed, as result, Payday soundtrack made my childhood. Simon Viklund, most likely you will not hear this, but you are my damn personal hero. Anyway, i managed to read the whole book in a week while listening to blasting soundtrack. As result, i managed to make a calculator with graphical interface by writing a thousand lines of code on Java and i used Java Swing library for UI. Of course it wasn't fancy, but it was a good groundbreaking progress for me to make this thing on my own, starting from that point i realized that i can look forward for other things to learn to get closer to my original idea of making a first person shooter. Yeah, i had some other projects in Java that i made out of curiousity, such as an attempt to make Minesweeper with an infinitely generatable field, but i didn't get much of a progress in these projects. After learning Java, i didn't want to return to Pascal because it was rather limiting in all ways. Surprisingly, there was an option to use C++. Additionally, C++ could've been used to make your very own game engine, and i wanted to make one to get cleaner idea of how game engines are functioning inside. So learning C++ could be helpful in all ways, and as it follows C++ became my ultimate goal for that time period. I learned it relatively easy because Java is pretty much C-like language even given all the OOP stuff it has. It took me 12 days to master the basics of leg-shooting skill. Just saying, the basics, this language is really complex and i still didn't master it on an actually good level... Actually Bjarne himself says he knows just 80% of this beast of a language... In either way, i've got enough knowledge to progress further and end up with making a basic rendering engine with barebones support of Bullet Physics engine and i also made a Minecraft-like world generator that would generate infintely as you move with the camera. Even if these things may sound very basic, they helped me a lot to learn more about various algorithms used in terms of game development and the other most important thing that are basics of linear math. Besides that, i learned that making of a game and making of an engine are two completely different things because they have drastically different, time-costy problem sets. Originally i wanted to make a game, so i switched over anything that would be more helpful for me to make a game. Garry's Mod interested me the most because it was a nice game to play with friends and it had a lot of possibilities to make mods for this game, but what interested me the most is possibility to write Lua and possibility to share your work with others. So i learned it all from "Code Blue" channel, rest in peace my dude, it was so damn fun to learn it all. I even ended up with writing ten thousand lines of Lua for a project named "TerritoryWars" that added a whole advanced group wars system into game. Yeah... Ten thousand lines of disaster...

I'll start from telling more about myself. When i've written the plot of this episode, i ended up telling way too much about myself, so if you are interested to hear more about my biography related to game development, let me know in the comments. Either way... I started to learn programming at 12 because i wanted to make a Minecraft Forge mod as it was a nice way to learn more about game development. I've been reading "Head First Java" book that made me completely switch attention from making a mod to learning this language in general. At 13, i've been participating in "competitive programming" events that helped me to learn more about data structures and algorithms, the only downside is that i had to switch attention from Java to Pascal. I returned to Java when i almost were 14 and i had to start reading the book from scratch. After making my first calculator with UI in 14, i switched over C++ to shoot my own legs in attempts to make barebones game engine, which was an extremely helpful experience as i learnt various algorithms, the basics of linear math and how game engines function inside. That also made me realize that making a game and making an engine are two different kinds of things as they have 2 completely different problem sets. In 15-16, i moved on to making Garry's Mod mods, such as TerritoryWars addon that added a whole advanced group war system into game, but in the end, it ended up being a ten thousand lines of disaster on Lua, it had a lot of problems related to design of user interface, the game design and etc. It was an interesting experience, but i had to move on from this too. In 16, i learned more about Unity and started to make my very first shooter, the Escaper project which had procedurally generated weaponry, procedurally generated hands, and cube-like characters. I had to scrap this project because it was very poorly written and had very much undefined design, so i started making the version 2 of the project that had completely different design and included things made with skeletal animation, however, i had to stop working on this project as well because i realized that i have major issues with sound design, modelling and level design. Each three aspects are huge on their own and require a lot of focus on them, learning them is like a separate project, so that became my target for age of 17. I learned more about sound design through huge variety of tutorials and that helped me to master making of soundscapes and other huge variety of sounds such as sounds for weapon animation and user interface. Besides that, learning more about sound design helped me to understand how to make music as it can be treated as an organized sound. I can't say much about modelling, but my main issue with modelling was related to use of no references. After starting to use references and treating the process as "from big to small" when you start from blockouts and end with detailing, i managed to make a bunch of neat projects, one of them is that military character. At 18, i wanted to learn more about level design and environment art, but these 2 topics were very confusing for me as it is hard to find a universal way to learn it. In any way, i perfectly understood that i need to make levels in a way to be able to share it with others to get player's feedback, and that's where i found Garry's Mod useful again, i made a good bunch of maps such as gm_liminal_space and gm_post_ussr both of which helped me to practice in this confusing kind of skillset, gm_post_ussr especially helped me to learn more about creation of props and textures for Half-Life-2-esque environments which i personally liked the most. And at this point, i really wanted to get back into creation of my first-person shooter because i felt more confident with my skills, however, one group of developers, name of whose i'd like to keep in secret, invited me to participate in their project and i found this interesting. They wanted to use Godot for a very undefined reason and i didn't like that decision, but later on, i kinda started to like this engine for it's simplistic design. Sadly, they kicked me out and promised me to not use any of my developments that i made in terms of the project, such as a player viewmodel system and a humanoid model system. I didn't really want to use Godot for this project, because i didn't find it to be advanced enough to fit the needs of the project, but at 19 i decided to make a sandbox-like project anyway to test this engine out and i ended up making the Index: Purger on Godot. I'm 20, and i still make this game and finally i wish to tell more about it on Youtube with hope to get a community around it that would help me to balance my decisions to make this shooter better for everyone.

Half-Life 2:
Half-Life 2 is a very influencial game which affected a lot of shooters and this game project is not an exception in this case. I'm going to tell the key moments which inspire me personally the most:
- The graphics. Game developers and studios tend to lean for realistic graphics, which kinda kill the videogamey vibe that i love. Half-Life 2 keeps the balance in everything while keeping that menacing surreal atmosphere. And if you ask me "How videogame should look like", i'd provide Half-Life 2 as one of the examples how a videogame should look like in my opinion. Graphics in this game are being a good example for me, which also age surprisingly well. And what makes it better is that workflow for their textures and props is suprisingly easy, which is extremely handy for the needs of this project.
- The environmental sound design. Source engine uses the soundscape system to make it easier to organize and use ambience in game levels. Index: Purger features similar system to make more interesting soundscapes.
- The game loop. Or, to be more precise, how non-repetitive it is. It is very hard to achieve, but if you want to make a worthy singleplayer campaign, it is a must. I would like to talk a bit more about that in a section about this game's design.
- Dystopian setting. This project, alongside with the beta version, is what keeps me interested in creation of dystopian setting. In my opinion, dystopian cityscape can be a decent base for variety of game levels that are interesting to explore, fun to play and relatively easy to create.

:: Materials
Index: Purger is using PBR (also known as Physically Based Rendering) for all of the materials in the game. However, it is worth to mention that my usage of PBR is quite different from the "traditional" ways if i can say it this way. Firstly... Instead of basic albedo, normal, roughness, metallic and ambient occlusion maps, i'm using different set of textures. They are called... Diffuse, normal and MRSAO maps. That allows to save a couple of texture switch operations of OpenGL and potentially is saving up the VRAM a little bit. MRSAO texture map is a texture created by a technique named "Channel Packing" that allows you to put several textures into one. In this case, MRSAO stands for "Metallic, Roughness, Specular, Ambient Occlusion", red channel has metallic texture, green channel is equal to roughness, blue channel is equal to specular and is honestly kinda unused, and alpha channel (basically transparency of the texture) has ambient occlusion value in it. Channel packing works well in cases when you have multiple grayscale texture maps. Normal map is self-explanatory in this texture set, however, diffuse map may be questionable. Firstly, there is a big difference between "albedo" and "diffuse" maps, even if both of them make the material of your object colorful, they have a difference that is related to lighting information built into this texture map. Albedo has no lighting at all which can be used for many cases of realtime PBR lighting, however, Godot has a problem when it comes to "lightmapped" lighting. Lightmaps lack of possibility to calculate lighting in a way that would take in count normal maps and specularity of the material. So, if you will use an albedo texture in a Godot scene that is using lightmapping, you will end up with bland, flat material that doesn't really look great. Since i'm using lightmaps to support various lighting scenarios in an optimized way, i ended up making and using a "diffuse" map. "Diffuse" maps are the colored maps that contain lighting information. Think about older games like Half-Life 2, basically all of the colored textures you can see in this game are "diffuse" maps. Many of the PBR materials available online contain only "albedo" map, so the question is how to turn the "albedo" map into the "diffuse" map? My solution for now is to use normal map. I drag it on top of the albedo map as a separate layer, make it grayscale, change the layer blending mode to "overlay", tweak sharpness and etc. That's the "diffuse" map. So, having this set of textures allows me to create ultimately any PBR material. Does it mean that i am strictly limited to full PBR materials only? No. Some things just look great if you use diffuse map only. That is true for building facades or for peeling plaster walls. As for buildings, i use a combination of "diffuse" and "gloss mask" textures to make the windows reflective. Honestly, i love to talk about the materials and rendering, but it takes too long already.

- How This Project was Started?
This project was started at May 2022 as a hobby project in form of the first-person shooter, main goal of the project was to make a basic prototype of first-person shooter on Godot Engine just to see how far can it go. Back then i thought this engine isn't advanced enough for that kind of stuff, but the more i've been working with it, the more fun i found it to use, it was so easy to make a game with it, much easier than Unity for some reason. When Unity stripped me of possibility to control anything with code usually forcing to use workflows that i don't like, Godot given an actual possibility to automize everything with code and set up my own rules for everything, which i highly appreciate and that basically untied my hands in all possible ways. The project has slowly became a heavy prototype with mechanics and huge variety of blockouts in relatively short amount of time, becoming a strong foundation to build a fast-paced first-person shooter. I'm not saying that Godot is a flawless engine, but people underestimated (and still seem to underestimate) its possibilities in making of 3D games. Godot still cannot compete with other engines that have broad marketplaces for assets and various game systems and that may have more polished features for making of 3D games in general, but Godot is certainly unique when it comes to creation of the game from scratch as prototyping is extremely fast, you have a total control over everything and you will not have anything that would make your game heavier from the start due to lightweight design of the engine. Besides that Godot can be used for creation of any kind of lightweight standalone application, which may be useful for creation of utility tools or other kinds of programs, such as the one that i use to make this entire video...

:: Escape From Tarkov.
- Honestly that is the game that made me interested in tacticool stuff in general, so it might affect the visual design of weaponry and characters directly. However, this game also includes powerful recoil (which was recently lowered down) and an amazing implementation of flashbangs. I love the recoil model of Tarkov which includes offsets for weapon, head and crosshair, so it was recreated in this game but in more acceptable way for a fast-paced shooter. Flashbangs were recreated too, because probably you cannot just make an old-fashioned white screen after seeing how nicely this thing can function if done right. Besides that, this game became an inspiration for more broad selection of equipment in loadout menu as well as for implementation of helmet's visors that can be damaged during battle. And, as the last thing, it inspired me to make bright spots in night-vision goggles.
